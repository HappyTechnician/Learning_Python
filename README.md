# Learning_Python
A repository for my code samples during my learning experience with Python, C++ and GitHub.

If you are braching from this repo you are doing so at your own risk, due to my in-experiance..
MOST of the code snippets and projects in this repo are from books and YT video lessons( I am more of a copy-cat than a programmer).
I will try to include a table of contents as I push more code to this repo..
